## DECENTRALIZED INTELLIGENCE ##


## AI Agent ##
Using openly available chat models from Ollama, we are creating AI Chatbots that can do things for us. 

GOAL: Create an affordable agent that can do several things to simplify task. With ability to store user preference as well as memory. 

WHY? ** AI agents are taking over the world, and we want to be on the safer side of history. 

Developments until now
## User preference ##
Saved as array, loaded as sentences, appended to user prompt.

## Memory ##
Saving useful information about users. This can be helpful to remember the user and their preference, to provide a personalized experience

## Agentic behaviors ##
Expanding agentic behaviors to run some kind of task for the user. This will be implemented as we integrate features from langchain ecosystem.
