## DECENTRALIZED INTELLIGENCE ##

## The why ##
1. I use ChatGPT & Gemini but I want to be able to make AI agents.
2. I want to use and AI model and get it to do things for me, like go on a website and fetch information.


### Problem ###
Currently, what we have is either pay for AI tool like GPT plus or pro / gemini pro, or use cli for using AI. Using the LLMs continuously for more than a year, I have grown kind of dependent on them, often opening up and even sharing secrets I would be wary of sharing in public.

Based on a short survey done on a group of people that regularly use LLMs like ChatGPT, here are some sensitive info they have shared:
1. Financial portfolio,
2. Political beliefs,
3. Personal relationship issues, including present and past.
4. Name of real person related to the social or family circle of users.
5. Intimate personal details.

Hence, there is a risk that because of the current monopoly in the AI market with large nearly monopoly giants, people are in even more risk of losing their privacy!

### Solution ###
A decentralized AI that stays completely in control of the people. No personal data is shared with anyone or training the model. The user is in complete control of their data. The AI agent is decentralized. 


## AI Agent ##
Using openly available chat models from Ollama, we are creating AI Chatbots that can do things for us. 

GOAL: Create an affordable agent that can do several things to simplify task. With ability to store user preference as well as memory. 

WHY? ** AI agents are taking over the world, and we want to be on the safer side of history. 

Developments until now
## User preference ##
Saved as array, loaded as sentences, appended to user prompt.

## Memory ##
Saving useful information about users. This can be helpful to remember the user and their preference, to provide a personalized experience

## Agentic behaviors ##
Expanding agentic behaviors to run some kind of task for the user. This will be implemented as we integrate features from langchain ecosystem.
