Yesterday was honestly one of the strangest days I’ve had in a while. It started off completely normal — I woke up around 7 AM, made myself some black coffee, and went for a short jog around the neighborhood like I usually do. But right after I got home and showered, I got a message from an old college friend I hadn’t heard from in over seven years. She said she was in town unexpectedly and asked if I wanted to grab lunch. At first, I wasn’t sure — we weren’t even that close back then — but I figured why not. I didn’t have anything urgent at work, and I’ve been trying to be more open to spontaneous things lately.

We ended up meeting at this small ramen place downtown, which turned out to be packed. We waited like 20 minutes just to get a seat, but the conversation actually flowed way better than I expected. Turns out she went through a rough divorce last year and had been traveling around Asia to clear her head. She looked different — more grounded, more serious. But she still had that sarcastic edge I remember. At one point we were laughing so loud, the guy next to us asked us to tone it down. She offered to pay for lunch, but I insisted — it felt like the right thing to do.

After lunch, I had to head back to my apartment because I had a Zoom meeting with our backend team at 3 PM. But the call was a mess — the lead dev was late, and we spent almost 45 minutes debating whether we should even start migrating to the new microservice design this sprint. I mostly stayed quiet, but internally I was frustrated — we’ve been talking about this for two weeks now and no decisions are being made. After the meeting, I felt mentally drained, so I decided to just take the rest of the day slow.

Around 6 PM, I went out to the park near my place with a notebook. I’ve been trying to write more lately — not for work, just personal stuff, journaling mostly. I wrote down some thoughts about the day, especially about the conversation with my old friend. Seeing someone after so long, especially when they’ve clearly changed — it makes you reflect on yourself too. I realized I’ve been holding onto some bitterness from my own past that I haven’t really processed.

Anyway, I stayed at the park until it got dark. I saw a couple walking their dog and a kid trying to catch fireflies. It was oddly peaceful. I didn’t even check my phone that much. When I finally got back home, I made a quick dinner — just eggs and toast — and watched an episode of a documentary series before going to bed. Nothing flashy, but the day made me think. It reminded me how important it is to pause, observe, and actually feel what’s going on around you.
